Each of these sequences is generated from one of two separate Markov processes.  The label (aka class) of the process that generated the sequence is given in the dataset.  \n",

To do this, for each class compute the prior probability $\\mathbf{\\pi}_c$ of each nucleobase (the relative frequency of each nucleobase for each class, a vector of length 4) and the matrix of transition probabilities \n",

Comparing the computed likeihood for a given sequence between different classes forms the basis of a classifier in a very similar manner to naive Bayes.  The difference this time is that now each random variable depends on the one before it in the sequence, whereas in naive Bayes we assumed that all the random variables were independent.    \n",
